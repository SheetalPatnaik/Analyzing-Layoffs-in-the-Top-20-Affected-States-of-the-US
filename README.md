In this project I have developed two pipelines for loading various CSV files into MySQL Workbench. In the first approach, I have utilized Python to ingest the CSV files, conduct cleaning and transformation operations within Python, and subsequently establish a MySQL connection via Python to load the transformed data into MySQL Workbench tables. Alternatively, in the second pipeline, I leveraged Apache NiFi as our ETL tool to read the data, perform transformations into JSON format, and then convert the JSON data into SQL. This SQL data is then loaded into MySQL Workbench tables.
